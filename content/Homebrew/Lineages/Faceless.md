*The Faceless are a mystery, even among experts. Their true origin is unknown - some say they were victims of a great disaster, while others claim they were cursed by a powerful sorcerer. Whichever is true, the Faceless are masked wanderers, speaking through telepathy and unleashing bursts of color and emotion upon the world.*
