In addition, you learn the *Guidance* cantrip. This cantrip does not count against the number of cantrips that you can learn.
#### Limited Precognition
Your variants rest close to, but not exactly at your place in time. You can link to your variants that are slightly ahead of you in time, granting you advantage on all initiative rolls. In addition, when you make a saving throw or ability check, you can use a reaction to give yourself advantage. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per short rest.
#### Wanderer's Rest
Starting at 6th level, you and your variants have created an extrauniversal space to take refuge in. This space can look however you choose, but must contain some source of knowledge, like a library or a database. Entering this extrauniversal space takes one minute, and you can take as many allies within 10 feet of you as you wish. In addition, whenever you take a long rest, you gain the following benefits:
- You can change your apperance, as with the Change Appearance effect of the *Alter Self* spell. This transformation lasts until you next long rest.
- You gain proficiency in 2 skills of your choice until the next time you long rest.
#### Universal Reach
Also starting at 6th level, you learn how to change where your spells are cast from. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose for it to originate from another point you can see within 15 feet of you.
#### Seeing Double
Starting at 10th level, you learn how to draw on your variants to duplicate your spells. When you cast a spell, you may choose to duplicate it, choosing new targets, areas, and options for the spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier per short rest.
#### Me, Myself, and I
Starting at 14th level, you can summon another of your variants to fight alongside you. Once per long rest, you can choose a point within 30 feet of you. You summon a duplicate of yourself in that position, which acts immediately after your turn. The duplicate has half your maximum HP, shares spell slots and concentration with you, but can take its own actions and movement on its turn. The duplicate disappears after one minute or after you dismiss it (no action required).
