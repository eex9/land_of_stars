# Warlock: The Phoenix
Your pact is that of fire, and of change. Warlocks of the Phoenix find themselves deep in battles of all kinds, from bloody wars to fights against tyranny. Where you will take your fire next is only up to you and the winds of change.

In addition to these spells, you learn the cantrips *Produce Flame* and *Control Flame*. These do not count against the number of cantrips you can learn.
#### Phoenix Form
Starting at 1st level, you can take on the form of your patron. When you take on this form as a bonus action you gain the following benefits for one minute:
* All of your attacks deal extra fire damage equal to your **Phoenix Die + your proficiency bonus**.
* Starting at 6th level, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after finishing a long rest.
#### Blazing Rebirth
Starting at 6th level, you have familiarized yourself with the cycle of life and death enough to be able to resist death. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a charisma saving throw **(DC: 5 + half the damage taken)**. On a success, you instead drop to one hit point, and creatures within 15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving throw **(DC: Spell Save DC)** or take 3d6 + PB fire damage, or half as much on a failed save. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
#### Embers of Revolution
Starting at 10th level, you know how to make a crowd follow your lead. When you enter your Phoenix Form, you can choose one of the following options:
* **Inspire the crowd.** You make a persuasion check to try to get the crowd to follow your lead. If you succeed, you can choose one action that the crowd follows, such as "Storm the castle". The crowd has advantage on checks with 2 skills of your choice for the next hour.
* **Deadly Omen.** You make an intimidation check to try to intimidate enemies. If you succeed, all enemies that can see you are afraid of you and have disadvantage on saving throws from your spells for the next ten minutes.
* **Rebirth.** You make a performance check to try to inspire your allies to continue fighting. On a success, all allies within 60 feet of you regain **2 * Phoenix Die + your proficiency bonus** hit points and have advantage on their next attack roll or ability check.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
#### Fires of change
Starting at 14th level, you know how to harness the fires of change for your own benefit. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed. When a creature within 60 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can choose whether it succeeds or fails. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
### Warlock Invocations
##### Fires of Rage
When you cast a spell or hit with an attack, you ignore resistance to fire damage.
##### Fires of Grief
When a creature takes fire damage from a spell or attack made by you, that creature's speed is reduced by half this turn.
##### Incendiary Offerings
Prerequisite: Blazing Rebirth feature, Pact of the Tome
You can use your tome to fuel your Blazing Rebirth. You can use Blazing Rebirth a number of times equal to **your charisma modifier** (minimum 1), after which your book goes up in flames.
##### Phoenix's Talon
Prerequisite: Phoenix Patron, Pact of the Blade, 6th level
Your patron teaches you the secrets of the fires of change. Your pact weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage, and while in Phoenix form, you score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.
##### Aspect of the Phoenix
Prerequisite: Phoenix Patron, Pact of the Chain, 6th level
Your patron imbues your familiar with fiery energy. Your familiar's attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage, and they gain a 30 foot flying speed while you are in phoenix form if they didn't have it already.
