# Sorcerer: Soul Shaping
The soul barrier is the magical barrier that prevents external magic from affecting one's body. Some people, through experimentation, a quirk of their birth, or just plain luck, have the ability to manipulate their soul barrier to affect themselves and their surroundings.
### Soulshaping
Starting at 1st level, you learn how to shape your soul barrier to affect other people and objects. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Soulshaping table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

| Sorcerer Level | Spell |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1st | Mind Sliver, Identify, Sanctuary |
| 3rd | Gentle Repose, Pass Without Trace |
| 5th | Magic Circle*, Leomund's Tiny Hut |
| 7th | Death Ward, Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum, Otiluke's Resilent Sphere |
| 9th | Rary's Telapathic Bond, Wall of Force |
*When cast using this feature, Magic Circle can also target a creature within sight. When cast using a higher-level spell slot, it can target additional creatures equal to the difference.*
### Soul Marks
Starting at first level, you have learned how to see and mark the souls of other creatures. As a bonus action, you can color the soul of another creature you can see, which is only visible to you. This mark stays if it changes form or body. You may also choose to give it one of the following effects:
- **Telepathic Mark**. While this mark affects the creature, you can speak telepathically with it within a number of miles equal to your sorcerer level.
- **Confounding Mark**. The next time this creature has to make a wisdom, intelligence, or charisma saving throw against one of your spells, you can force it to subtract 1d4 from its roll. This effect of the mark disappears after it is used.
You can mark a number of creatures in this way equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. You may dismiss marks at any time, as long as you can see the marked creature.
### Extension of the Self
Starting at 6th level, you learn how to extend your soul barrier and cast spells through it. As an action, you can choose a point within 30 feet of you. You extend your soul barrier out to that point and can cast spells from that point as if you were there. In addition, you can use an action to move your sight to that point or back to your body.
### Soul Bubble
Starting at 6th level, you can envelop your spells in a protective shield. When you cast a spell, you can choose to expend a number of sorcery points equal to its level to protect it from being dispelled. *Counterspell* and *Dispel Magic* have no effect on the spell. In addition, if the spell dealt damage and didn't attempt to be countered, it deals extra psychic damage equal to your sorcerer level whenever it would deal damage.
### Exclusion Zone
Starting at 14th level, you learn how to temporarily expand your soul barrier to cover an extremely large area. As an action, you can cause your soul barrier to expand into a 30-foot sphere centered on you. When a creature attempts to cast a spell in this area, if it is below the highest-level spell slot you have that is currently not expended, you can choose for it to fail. Otherwise, you can use your reaction to force it to make a charisma saving throw (DC: Spell Save DC) or lose the spell. This effect lasts for one minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you take a long rest.
### Shattered Barrier
Starting at 18th level, you learn secrets of the soul barrier that were never meant to be discovered. You learn the *Disrupt Soul Barrier* homebrew spell, and can cast it without expending a spell slot once per long rest. In addition, if you hold concentration for at least one minute, that creature's soul barrier is permanently weakened. Your spells can affect that creature as if the spell was still affecting it. If you hold concentration for the full duration, the target's soul barrier is permanently destroyed, reducing the target's maximum HP by **your sorcerer level + your proficiency bonus** and making it so that the creature is always under the effect of the spell.
