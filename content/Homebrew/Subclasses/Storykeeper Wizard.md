# Wizard: The Storykeeper
Stories are everywhere. Their lessons teach countless young the dangers of the world, and through them, the self of the author can be visible to all. So what happens when stories start appearing in your daily life? It can start with something simple, but it expands to so much more - How much is there to uncover? How can you harness this power for your benefit?
#### Heroic Countenance
*Second level storykeeper feature*
When you choose this school at second level, you learn the cantrip *Friends*, which does not count against the number of spells you can learn, and when you charm a creature, you can choose whether it has advantage or disadvantage on attacks, ability checks, and saving throws.
#### Trope Talk
*Second level storykeeper feature*
Also at second level, you have learned to influence the story around you. You learn one of the following tropes, which you can use as actions. You can use the option you selected a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
* **We're not so different.** Pick a target within 60 feet that you can see. The target must make an intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failiure, your souls are linked. For one minute, whenever you take damage, the target takes half the damage, rounded down.
* **Five Man Band.** Pick up to 4 targets other than yourself. For one hour, you and the targets apply your proficiency bonus to a check of your choice (even if you would already apply it), and you and the targets gain 1d6 temporary hit points.
* **Violence is always the answer.** Choose one target you can touch. They reroll ones and twos for damage dice on their next attack or spell they make or cast.
* **You two should kiss!** Choose two targets within 60 feet that you can see. Both make intelligence saving throws against your spell save DC. On a failiure, they are charmed by each other and have disadvantage to attack creatures unless they are attacked first for one minute.
* **Collateral damage.** Choose one target within 60 feet that you can see. The target must make an intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failiure, its next spell or attack it casts hits an additional target of your choice within range of the attack. The target cannot be the original target, and the second target takes damage equal to the damage the first attack dealt.
#### Plot Armor
*Sixth level storykeeper feature*
At sixth level, you have learned to bend the story to keep yourself safe. When a creature hits you with an attack, you can choose to gain resistance to that type of damage for the next minute. You can only use this feature once per long rest. In addition, you learn an extra trope.
#### The Power of Friendship!
*Tenth level storykeeper feature*
At tenth level, you have learned to harness the power of friendship to assist you and your allies. As a bonus action, you can pick any number of targets that you can see. The targets gain 1d10 temporary hit points, and add your proficiency bonus to their next attack, ability check, or saving throw. You can use this feature only once per long rest.
#### Freaky Friday
*Fourteenth level storykeeper feature*
When you roll initiative, you may choose 2 creatures that you can see. If you do, you may swap any two abilities or attacks from their stat blocks, such as exchanging your fighter's shortsword attack for a storm giant's greatsword attack, or exchanging your heroic countenance for a beholder's eye rays. If you choose a legendary action, the target gains one legendary action if it does not have any. In addition, you can pick another trope.
