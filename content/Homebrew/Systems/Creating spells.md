Players can create new spells. Depending on their class, how much time they spend, and what resources they use, things can go wrong- or great.
# Core
If a character has spellcasting, there are 2 ways they can attempt to make a new spell - **Heat of the Moment** or **Researching and Tinkering**.
### Researching and Tinkering
The player spends time and resources to create a new spell. The player spends a number of weeks equal to 5 * the spell's level, and gold equal 5 * the cost of making a spell scroll of the same level. They then make a check with **Advantage** using their spellcasting ability with a DC of **15 + Spell level - Proficiency Bonus**.

On a success, choose from one of the templates below, or work with your DM to create a new spell. On a failure, there is a minor mishap. Work with your DM to determine what quirk the spell has. The spell is added to your class's spell list for you and you gain a spell scroll of that spell.
### Heat of the Moment
The player attempts to modify a spell or come up with a new one in the heat of the moment. When casting a spell, they can instead choose to make an **Emphasized Roll** with their spellcasting ability with a DC of **21 - Spell slot level**.

On a failure, roll a d4, then roll on the corresponding **Wild Magic Table**, as shown below. The spell slot is still expended.

| Roll | Table |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 5e Wild Magic Table |
| 2 | [Expanded Wild Magic Table](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-XaXNuZPQc4F) |
| 3 | [Vanilla-friendly Wild Magic Table](https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/gh8g2e/i_added_50_more_vanillafriendly_additions_to_the/) |
| 4 | [Fey-themed Wild Magic Table](https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/rttw3p/ready_to_become_one_with_the_feywild_wild_magic/) |
On a success, the player chooses one of the following templates to modify, in addition to any added by their class. DMs may choose to keep track of the spells, or they may not. Heat of the Moment spells are not added to the player's spell list, if applicable.
## Templates
#### Abjuration
Abjuration magic is focused on blocking, banishing, and protecting.
*Variable-level Abjuration*
**Casting time**: One action, bonus action, or reaction
**Range**: Self or 5ft
**Components**: S, V
**Duration**: 1 Round
You grant yourself or an ally protection from damage, conditions, or magic. Choose a damage type or condition. You gain resistance to that damage type or immunity to that condition for the duration. You cannot choose the *Incapacitated* or *Unconscious* conditions this way. If you cast this template using an action, you may choose two. 
If you cast this using a third-level or higher spell slot, you may instead choose a school of magic. You may choose whether you gain advantage saves against spells of that school, or whether creatures have disadvantage on saves on spells of that school cast by the target.
#### Conjuration
Conjuration magic is focused on creation and summoning; creating something out of nothing.
*Variable-level Conjuration*
**Casting Time**: One action
**Range**: 25ft
**Components**: S, M (A material related to the summoned object or entity), V
**Duration**: 1 Minute
You conjure a minor portion of an element or a minor spirit. Choose a mundane item or choose an elemental or beast with CR 1/2 or less of the spell's level. If you chose a mundane item, you conjure one of that item. It lasts for 30 minutes or until you dismiss it. If you chose an elemental or beast, you summon one of that creature. It lasts for 2 minutes or until dismissed.
#### Divination
Divination magic is focused on knowledge and information.
*Variable-level Divination*
**Casting time**: 1 minute or 10 minutes (Ritual)
**Range**: Self
**Components**: S, M (An object relating to each target of the spell), V
**Duration**: 8 Hours
You grant yourself and a number of allies up to your proficiency bonus arcane knowledge. Choose a number of skills, creatures, places, events, or items equal to the spell slot level expended. If you chose a skill, you gain proficiency in the skill if you don't have it, or advantage on checks with it if you do. If you chose a creature, place, event, or item, you gain arcane knowledge about it. This is left up to the DM, and may not include all the information you desire.
#### Evocation
Evocation magic is focused around raw magical energy and damage.
*Variable-level Evocation*
**Casting time**: 1 action
**Range**: 30ft
**Components**: S, V
**Duration**: Instantaneous
You blast a wave of raw magical energy. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder, radiant, or necrotic. You deal damage to a number of targets equal to the spell's level as shown in the table below. If you cast this template with a spell slot of third level or higher, you may instead choose to deal damage in a 100-foot long, 5-feet wide line, 30-foot cone, 10-foot radius, 50ft tall cylinder or 15-foot cube instead. If you choose to do this, each target within the area must make a dexterity saving throw, taking half as much damage on a succesful save.

| Spell Level | Damage |
| ----------- | ------ |
| 1           | 1d6    |
| 2           | 4d6    |
| 3           | 8d6    |
| 4           | 5d10   |
| 5           | 8d8    |
| 6           | 10d6   |
| 7           | 10d8   |
| 8           | 12d6   |
| 9           | 40d6   |
#### Enchantment
Enchantment magic is focused on the mental state of the target, whether that intrusion be subtle or not.
*Variable-level Enchantment*
**Casting time**: 1 action or 1 minute
**Range**: 15ft
**Components**: S, V
**Duration**: 1 Minute (Concentration)
If you cast this template using an action, choose a number of targets equal to the spell's level. Choose for each target: 
- They must make a wisdom saving throw or be charmed. While charmed in this way, they have disadvantage on attack rolls or on a saving throw of your choice. 
- They deal extra psychic damage equal to a number of d6s equal to the spell's level or have advantage on attack rolls for the spell's duration.
If you cast this for one minute, you plant an idea in the target's mind over the course of the conversation. This can't be directly harmful to the target. If it would encourage the target to do something unreasonable, such as standing still for 8 hours, make a persuasion check and add the spell's level to the roll. The target makes a contested insight check against that roll. You may also choose a new direction for the conversation, if applicable. 
#### Illusion
Illusion magic focuses on creation of images and sounds that don't really exist.
*Variable-level Illusion*
**Casting time**: 1 Action
**Range**: 30ft
**Components**: S
**Duration**: 1 Hour (Concentration)
Choose a number of creatures up to or equal to the spell's level. Each of them hallucinates a visible or audible phenomenon of your choice. If you choose a visual effect, it must fit in a cube of 5 * the spell's level ft. Other creatures cannot see this phenomenon. If you cast this with a third-level or higher spell slot, you may choose to include both a visual and audible phenomenon.
#### Necromancy
Necromancy focuses on manipulation and summoning of spirits.
*Variable-level Necromancy*
**Casting time**: 1 Action
**Range**: 15ft
**Components**: S, V
**Duration**: 1 Minute (Concentration)
You cast the spirit of a creature into the ethereal plane. For the spell's duration, the creature is invisible and can move without provoking opportunity attacks and gains a hover speed equal to its movement speed. The creature cannot take actions other than the dash action while in this state. When the spell ends, you may choose whether the creature's spirit returns to its body or whether the body is drawn to the spirit. If the creature returns to its body, it returns to the position where it was when the spell was cast. If you cast this spell using a third level or higher level spell slot, the creature can take only an action or a bonus action on its following turn, as the lethargy that comes from having its spirit return to its body afflicts it. If the body is drawn to its spirit, the creature loses its hover speed and is no longer invisible. If it was in an occupied space, it returns to the nearest unoccupied space to it.
#### Transmutation
Enchantment magic is focused on transforming one thing into another, whether that's a person or the elements themselves.
*Variable-level Transmutation*
**Casting Time**: 1 Action or 1 Reaction (which you take in response to taking acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage)
**Range**: 30 Ft
**Components**: S, M (A portion of the element transmuted into), V
**Duration**: 1 Hour or Instantaneous
You transmute a portion of one element into another. If you cast this template using an action, choose fire, water, earth, or air, then choose an area of that element within range that fits within a cube of 5 * this spell's level. This transformation lasts for one hour. You turn it into an area of another element that fits within that same area. If you cast this using a reaction, transform the damage into another one of those damage types, then reduce the damage by half.
## Class-specific Templates

### Artificer | Wizard
Researchers of the Arcane, Artificers and Wizards know how to manipulate the weave to their advantage. You gain the following template:
#### Manipulate Weave
*Variable-level Transmutation*
**Casting time**: 1 Action
**Range**: 30 ft
**Components**: S, M (A ball of yarn), V
**Duration**: Variable
You conglomerate and shift the weave to your advantage. Choose one of the following effects:
- **Magical Sinkhole**. (1 Minute, Concentration) You create an area of incredibly dense magic. Choose a point within range. Magical effects such as *Darkness* or *Fog Cloud* within 30 feet move a number of feet towards this point equal to 5 times the difference in level of the spells. If the magical effect was cast at a higher level, it is unnaffected by this. If you cast this at third level or higher, creatures wearing or holding enchanted items within 30 feet can only move at half their normal movement speed while moving away.
- **Unravel**. (1 Round) You unravel the weave in an area temporarily. Choose a point within range. Magical effects of a lower level in that area are dispelled, enchantments of a lower level have no effect (A +1 weapon is a third-level enchantment), and spells of a lower level cannot be cast through it. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
### Bard

**Range**: 45ft
**Components**: S, V
**Duration**: Instantaneous
You attempt to modify a lower-level spell being cast by another creature. If this spell was cast using a spell slot higher than or equal to the spell's level, make a contested check against the other spellcaster using each of your spellcasting abilities. You add the difference in spell level to your check. If you are successful, you may choose a template you have access to. If you do, that spell is replaced by that template. You may choose any choices presented to you. If you don't, you instead steal the spell. You cast the spell at the same level it was cast at, choosing any targets applicable.
