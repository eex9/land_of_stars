Leylines are the lifeblood of the world, crisscrossing throughout the world. All leylines have their own quirks, though there are some similarities between them.
# Core
Leylines enhance magic, travel, and many other aspects of the world. 
### Travel
Many roads follow leylines, as they make travel faster and easier. While travelling in a leyline, the time of travel is reduced. The amount reduced depends on the journey, but is always reduced. If the time is less than a week, the time is reduced by 2 hours for every day. If the time is between one week and one month, the time is reduced by 1 day for every week. If the time is greater than one month, the time is reduced by one week for every month.
In addition, teleportation magic and travel magic is enhanced. While in a leyline, players may cast multiple leveled spells in a turn if one of them teleports or otherwise transports them.
### Magic
Leylines are places where the weave of magic is more dense, allowing for powerful magic. While in a leyline, spellcasters can allow the weave to take on the load of concentration of spells. When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to allow the weave to concentrate on the spell for you, with a DC of 12 + the level of the spell. If the check is successful, the spellcaster does not have to make concentration checks to keep the spell active, and can concentrate on another spell.
# Quirks
Though leylines may appear similar, each one is different from all others. Some enhance specific schools of magic, while others enhance physical properties of people. Some examples are listed below.
#### Leyline of Communication
Illusory sparks, butterflies, and other small magical effects flit through the skies in this leyline. All creatures in this leyline can cast the *Message* cantrip as a free action, and can spend one minute to cast *Sending*, though it may only target creatures also in the leyline.
#### Leyline of Spirits
Echoes of the dead move through the streets in this leyline. Ghosts are common here, and any spellcaster can cast *Speak with Dead* without expending a spell slot.
#### Leyline of Acrobatics
The weave enhances the ability of creatures to move precisely and swiftly. Creatures have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Strength (Athletics) checks. In addition, if a creature has proficiency in one of these skills, it may double its proficiency bonus in that skill while in the leyline.``
