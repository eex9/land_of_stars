Based on the Great Wheel, with aspects of Ebberon's Manifest Zones
# Inner Planes
#### Nexus
Nexus sits at the center of all planes and is the only way to travel between them. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to stay on Nexus for long, so spells like *Plane Shift* take more magical energy to cast. Some, but not all teleportation spells work by shifting to Nexus for a second - *Dimension Door* works this way, but not *Misty Step*.
Nexus also serves as a waiting plane for souls of the dead - Only people truly committed to their alignment are sent to the aligned planes, all others are reincarnated. 
#### [[World|Material Plane]]
The Shadowfell and Faerie are the only planes close enough to the Material Plane for manifest zones strong enough to transport people to their plane to occur regularly. These are know as Slipways or Fae Crossings. 
#### Shadowfell / Faerie
The Shadowfell and Faerie are echoes of the material plane, affected by the elemental planes they are close to - Negative and Positive energy planes, respectively.
#### Aligned Planes 
There are 8 aligned planes - corresponding to every alignment except True Neutral.
- Lawful Good - Mount Celestia %%based on 5e - rename?%%
	- A collection of high mountain peaks, strung together with bridges of wood and stone that connect massive stone temples. Clouds ring the bottom of the range, beyond which nobody returns from. Spirits sent here are battle-ready within days, as Mount Celestia is the plane to push back the endless incursions of the Abyss's demons.
- Neutral Good - Horizon
	- An infinite landscape, suited to fit each person who ends up there individually. The sky is shattered into a near-infinite number of shards, with every time of day and night at the same time. 
- Chaotic Good - Sky %%Sky: Children of the Light%%
	- A collection of islands floating in the sky, with environments varying from vast gravel beaches to lush green meadows. The sun never truly sets on this plane, only dips below the horizon line. Spirits sent here often manifest aspects of animals, and Sky is filled with play-like faction fighting. Anyone who dies on this plane comes back to life at the center of the plane or at the last place they slept upon the next nightfall.
- Lawful Neutral - Ordo %%Mechanus 5e%%
- Chaotic Neutral - Kaos %%limbo from 5e%% 
- Lawful Evil - Acheron %%Based on 5e%%
	- [Layers from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/isnbft/the_nine_hells_of_baator_i_made_the_layers_unique/)
	- Arranged in rings - Avernus is outermost, going inwards with large seperations between them depending on layer
		- Avernus (Battle) - Massive battlefield choked by smog, riddled with craters and rivers of blood. Seperated from Dis by massive cliffs.
		- Dis (Industry) - Abandoned city with acidic rain pouring down. Machines of industry hunt down all who find themselves on this layer. Separated from Minaurus by massive walls designed to hold back a wall of plants.
		- Minaurus (Nature) - An overgrown jungle with massive awakened plants everywhere you turn. Poisonous green fog seeps up from the ground in some places, forcing those who walk here to watch their every step. Separated from Phelgetos by a vast plane of ash, where nothing but fire grows.
		- Phelgetos (Predator) - Plane of obsidian and black stone, with rivers and lakes of fire crossing it like veins. Massive, amalgamated hunters cross the plane, forcing any stuck here to run or hide from them, or join them. Separated from Stygia by a vast ocean of fire and cold water.
		- Stygia (Cold Water) - An infinitely deep ocean, with pockets of ice and air being the only way to breathe on this layer. As dark as the bottom of the sea, massive deep-sea predators stalk the depths here. Separated from Malbolge by a wall of frozen flesh.
		- Malbolge (Life) - Massive caverns of flesh, made of bone marrow, muscle tissue, and various other substances that should only be inside your body. The walls leak stomach acid and blood, and eyes line the walls where it feels they shouldn't. Separated from Tenebrum by a wall of fog, where anyone who enters loses their way and themself.
		- Tenebrum (Darkness) - Dark forest where light attracts predators. Eyes watch from every part of the darkness, and when the fog blows in, it gets even darker than it already was. Separated from Cainia by a sheer wall upon which the mountains sit.
		- Cainia (Freezing Mountains) - Range of frigid mountains that expose its residents to the frigid wind. Warmth is hard to come by here, and burnable material is gone quickly. Separated from Nessus by a deep pit, just wide enough that it's impossible to get across, but possible to see Nessus.
		- Nessus (Vanity) - Center of the Nine Hells, home of Asmodeus, and the only way out other than through powerful magic. Echoes Mount Celestia through its construction - it's a collection of mountain peaks, with bridges strung between them and temples built into the rock.
- Neutral Evil - Cocytus %%All pain is equal%%
- Chaotic Evil - Abbadon %%Reskin abyss%%

Earth, Fire, Water, and Air - Also includes Positive and Negative Energy planes
Origin of Djinn and Elementals - Almost a primordial soup with how elementals form and act like single-celled organisms
