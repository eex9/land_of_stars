  - City
---
Lying in a massive crater from long past, the Brass Tower reaches tall into the sky and deep into the earth. Residents crowd past each other behind its walls, and lava flows just beneath the surface. Its nobility, sitting high atop the peak of the city, lounges, while the workers struggle to breathe beneath the smog.
#### Government
Outwardly appearing as a representative democracy, the city is run by gangs of organized crime with the nobility as figureheads.
#### Districts
(Organized top-down)
- The Crown
	- Housing for the city's nobility
	- Stuck-up, rich, sterilized, and too bright.
	- The sunlight beams into your eyes, almost painful after the rest of the city's darkness. Everything is designed to be noticeable, but not obtrusive.
- Upper Ward
	- Housing for the more well-off in the city
	- Open, clean, bright, and guarded.
	- Large houses seem to almost climb the walls. This layer is almost free of the dust and grime indicative of the other layers - almost. The policing here is much more strict, enacting curfews and even restrictions on walking.
- Market
	- Large market and housing of the trade part of the skyport.
	- Loud and free, with enough light to feel like twilight.
	- Outside of Ikassel, this market is one of the largest in all of Raea. The skyports ring the entire layer, clouding the open sky with incoming airships. Allies are common here, and enemies moreso.
- Inner City
	- Main entrance of the city
	- Loud and crowded, with many shops to appeal to tourists.
	- Crowded streets, reinforced windows, and grabby hands. Flourescent lighting and grime line the streets, and large, illuminated signs vie for attention. Keep your items close - pickpockets are everywhere on this layer, just waiting for you to drop your guard.
- The Battlegrounds
	- Salesplace for all manner of weapons and host of the Steel Coliseum
	- Loud, dark, and dangerous.
	- Lined wall-to-wall with shops selling all manner of deadly weapons, this layer attracts adventurers from all across the continent. The Steel Coliseum stands high above the rest, boasting year-round tournaments - though curiously, nobody has beaten their champion in several decades. 
- Lower Ward
	- Transition area, residential district, and host of many of the city's guildhalls
	- Warm, friendly, welcoming
	- Home to a majority of the city, the Lower Ward holds friendly faces and warm drinks. Adventurers can find solace in retirees of their career, scholars can find knowledge in the many open libraries, and experts can find help in masters of their craft.
- Old City
	- Home of the poor and organization for organized crime
	- Unclean, dark, cramped
	- The dirty streets crawl with rats. Many of the lights you can make out are shattered or simply out. The ceiling is close overhead, to the extent that it feels more like you're inside a house than a city. Rogues should find excitement in the fact that organized crime makes a home here.
- The Forges
	- Producer of the city's tech and mine for its metal
	- Dark, Dangerous, Utilitarian
	- Being belowground, the only light comes from the lava pouring from giant metal vats into an artificer's mold, or from the lantern that artificer carries from place to place. An artificer should be able to find a place at the forges easily enough, though they may have trouble with the hostility from their peers here.

###### Guilds/Factions/Colleges
- Lavalight College - Artificer's guild/college
	- Built into the rock of the forges lies the Lavalight College, an attraction for artificers of all manners. Here, amidst the glow of molten slag and the rhythmic beating of hammers, students and masters work in tandem to further their knowledge of their craft and the world around them. New enchantments and items are forged and logged in droves here; most useless when held to others, but some may just be hidden gems for you to find.
- The Brass Crown - Adventurer's League
	- The Brass Crown is a large Adventurerâ€™s Guild, with branches in many large cities. Adventurers move throughout the open guildhall, taking bounties, teleporting throughout the realm, and visiting its adventurer's store.
	- Ten: Warforged Rune Knight Fighter (They/It)
		- Doesn't move unless it has to. 
		- Wants to age and have real emotions and feelings like a mortal
		- 
###### Other
- The Steel Arena
	- Standing high above the Battlegrounds, the Steel Arena is an impressive sight to behold. The roar of the crowd is thunderous, and only getting louder. Passing through the gates, the false sky reveals itself, shining in all the shades of a sunset. Below, adventurers and gladiators alike sharpen blades in preparation for their battle. The pit is eternally bright, showing off the great battles happening between, whether that be gladiator combat, showcase fights, or monster battles. If you stay after closing long enough, though, you might just see a meeting you weren't supposed to see...
- The Skyports
	- Majestic ships and sounds of commerce. Near endless skies stretch outside of the skyports, the main entrance to the Brass Tower. You'll find all manner of goods passing through the city, from enchanted weapons, to powerful scrolls, to exotic livestock. Situated mostly on the north-west side of the city, they creep around the sides and even surround the Market to support the trade the city sees as the second-biggest trading city in the known world.
- The Mines
	- Deep in the heart of the city's forges lies a complex of winding tunnels and exotic minerals. The secret for the forges' prosperity lies in a dense meteorite - one containing all manner of magical and mundane metals and materials. Artificers come from all across the continent to find anything from celestial bronze to stygian iron - but beware: something may lie sleeping at its core, waiting for someone brave or stupid enough to wake it.
