At the intersection of the Leyline of Spirits and the Leyline of Acrobatics lies the heart of the City of Ghosts. Situated on a small plateau overlooking short, but steep cliffs, the town is a heart of magic and metal. Teens race down the streets on Leyboards, ghosts walk the ancient streets of the Overgrowth, and bright, magical lights blink on after dark.
#### Government
Semi-anarchistic
Each community (generally represented by district) sends one or more representatives to work through city-wide disputes/problem and discuss outside threats. Community-centric problems are handled in the community. No real police force outside of a volunteer militia that patrols the borders of the city to guard against raids.
#### Districts
- Overgrowth
	- Kodama vines and conjured bricks, the Overgrowth is the oldest part of Neon. Cutting through the Leyline of Spirits, most of its residents are ghosts or those looking after the elderly. Spirits generally call the city Quoane instead of Neon.
- The Garden
	- The new-city's attempt to replace the Overgrowth, the Garden is an idealized version of the Overgrowth's chaotic vine and spirit. Its residents are young, strong, and stubborn to change. Kodama is sown in rows, growing in orderly flower-gardens rather than through the Overgrowth's chaotic vines and grass-roofs.
- Downtown
	- A meeting of vine and electricity, Downtown is the only true combination of the new and the old. At the meeting of the Leyline of Spirits and the Leyline of Acrobatics lies the city center and home to the Pondermoss Fountain.
- The Cliffs
	- A bastion of bustling business, the Cliffs supply much of the city's infrastructure. Not many live in the Cliffs permanently; those who do are workers of arcanotech that keeps the Cliffs moving or weavers of great magic that keep both the encroaching plants from the Overgrowth and the continual erosion at bay.
- The Edge
	- As the city desperately searches for more space on its plateau, the younger generation looks upwards. The buildings in the Edge stretch higher than most of the rest of the city, even as the ground below drops towards the side of the plateau. Bright Arcanotech lights stubbornly flicker on after dark, and leyboards flick swiftly through the streets.
