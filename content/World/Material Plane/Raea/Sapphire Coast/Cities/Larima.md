  - City
---
The City of Stone follows the shore of the Calcus Peninsula, which lies on the Sea of Glass. Trams crowd the skies and magic lines the streets, as the sounds of commerce and merriment fill the city. The magically clean streets begin to show their telltale lapis blue accents as you approach the elevated sections, and hints of purple fill the skies with magic guides for tramways.
#### Government
Representative Democracy
###### Advisors
- Storykeeper Xisuma (Tortle Storykeeper Wizard) (He/They)
	- A large humanoid turtle. His shell is black with green spots, and holds a bag full of books that he uses for notes and stories. He doesn’t really pay attention at the meetings unless he’s needed for something. He knows a lot about history and can help the players with research - he doesn’t have a lot to do.
- Oracle Kaya (Sacred Nagaji Oracle) (She/They)
	- A sacred nagaji. She wears flowing clothing that drapes over her long form, and her jewelry helps her attune to the divine to foretell events. She’s often called into meetings to predict how major decisions will go, but with how cryptic the divine can be, the council often stays their path anyways.
###### Council
- Danfer Moonshine (Halfling Bard) (He/They)
	- A halfling bard. He wears a complex suit, and carries his Maestro’s Lute with him wherever he goes. He enjoys games of chance, and he’ll try to get your money in any way he can when he’s not in a meeting.
- Yimur (Fletchling Sorcerer) (He/They)
	- A fletchling sorcerer. He wears complex robes and is skeptical of almost everyone that comes before the council. He trusts the Storykeeper and the Oracle, though, so if you can get them to vouch for you, you might have a very powerful ally.
- Cobalt (Android Inventor) (It/They)
	- An android inventor. He wears plain clothes, and his body is covered in intricate designs that read as tattoos at first. His automata, Arum and Argentum, stand at his side, and he carries the Soulbender Bracers, which he uses to make simple homunculi quickly.
- Mira (Human Thaumaturge) (Any)
	- A human thaumaturge. She’s the newest member of the council, and has yet to earn their trust. They wear a long coat decorated with medals and various tools, and they hold Cecidimus, a shifting greater striking staff.
- Kedge (Azarketi Magus) (He/She)
	- An azarketi magus. He often leads discussions, and so he often comes off harsher than he really is. Though he wants the best for everyone that comes before the council, that’s often not possible. He carries Riptide, his concealable +3 greater striking trident.
- Outskirts - Eurus (Kitsune Summoner)
	- TODO

#### Notable Locations
###### Shops
- Ivory Square - Central Market
	- Many market stalls crowd the center of the large square, and larger buildings ring it. It’s open to the sky, and has an air of cleanliness.

	- Owner: Leia - Elf Alchemist (She/Her)
		- D(escription)
				A middle-aged elf. She wears a green dress with stripes of gold, and along her wrists are a number of bracelets of various sizes. (She/Her)

		- A(genda)
				Looking for someone to train to take her job.
	- Owner: Gold - Automaton Alchemist (They/Them)
		- D

		- A
			- Looking for adventure and to see the world.

		- D
			- A middle-aged dwarf with a bushy silver beard. He wears enchanted clothing that protects him from the dangers of his work, and carries his tools with him wherever he goes in an enchanted bag.
		- N
			- To learn. He wants to know everything there is about his craft, and volunteers to help at the artificer’s college on his off-time. He needs to know about anything he doesn’t recognize, and he’ll buy rare magic items from adventurers that have no use for them. He tries to support the community when he can, and his partnerships with the College of Stonework and the Opal’s Fire reflect this.
		- A
			- Wants to be remembered. He needs to leave a lasting legacy in the city and the wider world. By maintaining high standards and pushing the limit of his craft, he hopes to be remembered as a trailblazer and a pioneer in his field.
- Adventurer's League General Auction of Everything (ALGAE)
	- Just inside of the entrance to the Brass Crown, there’s a small general shop. Adventurers stop by often, buying rations, materials, or even just looking for information.
- Opal's Fire

	- Owner: Eldarion - Kitsune Thaumaturge (Any)
		- D
			- (Disguised) An older-looking human, wearing golden spectacles that seem to hold themself up. Their clothes are simple, yet expensive, and they wear several rings on various fingers.

###### Taverns/Inns
- Beholder’s Brews

	- Owner: Orion - Human Magus (He/Him)
		- D
			- A grizzled human with dark skin. He wears suspenders over simple clothing, and keeps his enchanted greatsword nearby at all times.
		- N
			- Some excitement. Retirement is great and all, and he has plenty of gold, but sometimes he just wishes something would happen.
		- A
			- Wants to get his adventuring party back together. They split up not too long ago, and he misses them.
- The Fey and the Favor
	- Though the enchantments may make it seem less lively, the Fey and the Favor is nearly as active as Beholder’s Brews. Built on the other side of town, the enchantments keep the noise down so that people who live nearby have an easier time sleeping.
	- Owner: Red - Beastkin Elf Rogue (He/She)
		- D
			- A wild-looking elf with pointed features and exaggerated features. He wears fanciful clothing the color of the feywild, and wears a golden necklace with the symbol of a flower on it.

		- A
			- Looking for information and connections. She runs the tavern as a way to peddle rumors and make connections with adventurers and scholars, and she allows payment in favors and information, if the favor or information is enough for him.
###### Other
- Ebony Square
	- Though smaller than its counterpart, the Ivory Square, it’s just as near and dear to the city it calls home. Plays, parades, protests, and speeches are often held here, as the Ivory Square is often too crowded to organize much of anything.
- Emerald Sky Casino
	- Laughter echoes through the air outside of the Emerald Sky. Inside, the emerald canopy of its star-filled ceiling shines upon its patrons, which sit around tables playing several different games of chance.
- Tiger’s Eye Theatre
	- Music hums throughout the small square outside this downtown theater. Inside, songs are performed by students of the Silver Strings, magic performed by the Book Keepers, and much, much more.
- Petal Grove
	- The small, elevated grove acts as home for the druidic Order of Blossoms. Taking up part of the Jasper village, it’s a place to relax and get away from the city.
###### Guilds / Factions
- College of the Silver Strings
	- Music fills the halls of this illustrious bard college. Teaching all styles of magical music, from charming melodies to explosive chants, the halls are never quiet here - someone’s always working on their next piece. Many of the student body’s pieces are performed at the Ebony Square or the Tiger’s Eye Theatre.
- College of the Book Keepers
	- Muted speech fills the halls of this mage’s college. Lectures drone on in large halls, while students hurriedly scribble down notes. Elsewhere, new spells are tested in labs as wizards and witches work to understand the fabric of the universe.
- College of Stonework
	- The halls of this artificer’s college are a blend of magic and industry, giving the college a distinct ambience of innovation and creativity. The hum of the college’s arcane core echo through the halls, underscoring conversations about student’s latest contraptions and innovations, interrupted only by the occasional burst of laughter and the scribbling of notes on parchment.
- Order of Blossoms
	- Flitting through the cities’ various parks and courtyards, the members of the Order of Blossoms give up the search for power for a life of helping others. Even so, this order is still one of the largest factions in the city, and their understudies go on to become some of the greatest druids in the realm.
	- Leader: Stone in Water (Nick: Stone) - Catfolk Druid ([Archetype](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8bn6fi/npc_archetypes/) - Healer) (He/She)

			- To keep people safe. He’s the most capable healer in the city, and people commonly come to the Order of Blossoms to heal illnesses or wounds. She keeps as many people as she can safe to prove herself wrong.
		- A
			- To collect every plant. Just like he wants to keep people safe, he also wants to keep every plant she can from extinction. He keeps his plants in a hidden grove that only he and other trusted individuals can access, and he’ll pay for seeds of any plant he hasn’t seen before.
	- Hireling: Cascade (Azarketi Wild Witch) (They/Them)
		- A slender Azarketi, they wear flowing clothing over dull blue skin. Their hands hold dual golden sickles, and their familiar, a small elemental taking the form of a cat, hovers around their legs. They don’t like fighting, preferring to talk first and only throw punches as a last resort. They’re very good at almost anything related to water - just try not to get them into a fight.
- The Keystone - Spiritual Center
	- Built into the side of the Copper Market, the Hearthstone holds a safe space for any who need it. Elara Lightbringer, the leader of the center, helps all who need it, and the powerful spells over the center grant refuge from many forms of magic that promise to spy on those inside. When Elara is busy with some pressing matters, her wife will usually take over and help with her duties at the center.
	- Leader: Elara Lightbringer - Human Cleric ([Archetype](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8bn6fi/npc_archetypes/) - Spiritual Leader) (She/Her)
		- D
			- A middle-aged female human. She wears the shoulder pauldrons of a suit of armor over clerical robes, and a hammer hangs from her belt. Her long, silver-streaked hair is usually pulled back into a neat bun, revealing a pair of kind, gray eyes that seem to hold a world of understanding.
		- N
			- Funding. As the city has grown larger, she hasn’t been able to secure more funding for the center, resulting in inadequate facilities for those that need it - there’s just not enough space for everyone that needs help. She’ll accept any help that she can get from adventurers or other people that the Iris council will listen to.
		- A
			- Help those in need. She is already working at this, advocating for social justice, helping people with spiritual development, and strengthening community bonds.

		- D

		- N

		- A
			- Gorrim wants to strengthen the adventurer’s guild and mentor the next generation of adventurers - that’s why he has partnerships with almost every other guild in the city.

	- Hireling(s)
		- Liriel Moonshadow (Elf Investigator) (She/They)
			- A slender elf with pointed features, Liriel is rarely seen without her trusty rapier and her well-worn notebook. Her long, silver hair is often tied back in a ponytail, and her clothes are tailored for stealth, incorporating shades of green and brown. She wants help with some of the quests - she doesn’t have a party, and she’s not very good at fighting, but if you can protect her, she has some experience with spirits.
		- Thorin Ironfist (Dwarf Champion) (He/Him)
			- A stout, muscular dwarf, Thorin is never seen without armor if he can help it. His fiery red hair is tied in intricate braids, and his bushy beard reaches down to his broad chest. His dwarven thrower is carefully sheathed at his back, alongside his trusty shield. He seeks help calming a spirit - he has the power to do it, but it will take a long time and he fears it will overwhelm him before he can finish.
	- [Board](https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/7fvtz9/d100_city_quests/)
		- There was a murder last night. Plenty of people saw the murder, but only half of them saw the perpetrator, and they’re describing it as a spirit.
		- There’s a gathering of spirits a ways away from town. Someone claims to have heard what they’re talking about, and it spells bad news for the city.
		- Several locals have committed uncharacteristic, violent acts. Each claims to have been commanded to do so by a benevolent deity in their dreams.
		- An old man is causing problems in town. The problem? It’s Orion’s father - and even in his old age, he’s still a very proficient fighter. The city guard can’t get close without getting hurt,
- Brotherhood of Merchants - Merchant’s Guild
	- This large guildhall is filled with traders and others of the type, looking to work with other merchants to make sure all of their stock is sold before day’s end. If you’re lucky, you might even get a discount on some merchant’s products!
- The Unseen Hand - Thieves’ Guild
	- The members of this secretive order move about the city, committed to a life of crime. The heads of this order stop petty crime while moving pieces around for some secretive plan, making the lives of the Company of Champions both harder and easier at the same time.
	- Hireling: Tuk (Goblin Rogue) (He/Him)
		- A stout goblin. He wears simple robes that disguise his figure - Goblins don’t have the best reputation, especially in a large city. His telltale hands have the mark of the Unseen Hand - three equilateral triangles, coming to a point. If you can find him, he’ll do anything you want - for a price.
- Company of Champions - City Guard
	- Though they have watchtowers throughout the city, the city guard’s largest base is built just off of the Ebony Square. They employ many guards - most being simple fighters, though they do employ some wizards and bards to handle problems that brute force can’t solve.
	- Leader: Skitter Swiftclaw - Ratfolk Gunslinger (They/It)
		- D
			- A ratfolk gunslinger. It wears a guard's uniform and carries a small handbook. Its fur is a mix of dark brown and black, with a few silver hairs. Their uniform is adorned with badges of honor, and they carry a small pistol that doesn’t look like it would do much damage.
		- N
			- To understand. The spirits are upset, and it doesn’t know why. People have started disappearing from the edge of town, one by one. The colleges are preoccupied with teaching, the Brass Crown has more pressing threats to deal with, and nobody seems to know what to do about it.
		- A
			- They want to make the guard force more effective. In its lifetime, the guardforce has if not seen many world-ending threats, seen at least the beginning of them. If it can find a way to discover what’s important, the adventurers might be able to stop the threats before they get too big.
