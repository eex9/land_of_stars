#### Notable Ruins
- Palace of Glass
	- A ruined palace that lies below the surface of the Sea of Glass. It used to be the palace of the Goddess of Water, but once she gave her life willingly to the Traveller, the palace sank and the Sea of Glass was formed. After the Falling, the remnant magic was salvaged and used to create Larima, the City of Stone.
