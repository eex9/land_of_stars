#### Pitch
- History is young, and magic is new. 
	- The spells you know and love exist, but youâ€™ll have to create or find them yourself.
- Ancient secrets await those brave enough to find them. 
	- Who knows what happened before people thought to record things?
- [[Creating spells|Magic comes from belief.]] 
	- Whether that be from a sacred wishing star a thousand years past, or a humble pet rock, belief can form powerful magic with time.
- Divinity is new. 
	* The old gods are dead. New deities walk the material plane in their incarnations, working to change the world as they see fit.

- Eidolons - Embodiments of concepts
	-  Almost never incarnate in a way comprehensible to mortals
	- Truenames not known to mortals (yet?)
- Dominions - Embodiments of places

	- Power is based on belief
		- Deity of a large city will have more power than one of a small lake
- Spirits - Multiple types
	- Angels
	- Fae
- Aspects - Born of mortals under extreme circumstances
	- A leader of an extremely influential movement might become an aspect
	- Can also happen in moments of extreme change
		- A soldier fighting a nearly impossible fight
	- Mortals without durable enough souls will shatter and be forgotten
	- Mortal name is usually forgotten except to the Aspect and those close to them
		- Determined by notable traits - not an actual name eg.
			- Angel of Death
			- Totem of Death
			- Blood of the Covenant
			- The Divine Blade
##### Other Notes
A deity's physical form is called an incarnation - most deities exist without them (except for Aspects)

Halo is a non-contagious magical illness that manifests when a mortal ascends to godhood without being ready, sees an eidolon's true form, or any other number of deific-related things. Can last anywhere from an hour to several days or months.
3 Stages
- 1. Complaining of sweating and feeling like their body is too small. Longest stage.
- 2. Skin becomes brighter and pupils disappear. Blood in the body changes to ichor in an incredibly painful process. Takes about half as long as first stage.
