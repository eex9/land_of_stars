title: Ataraxia, The Land of Stars
---
hi! welcome to. whatever this is. i'm astra midnight\_\_sun, and the land of stars is and has been my passion project for the past little while. come explore magic, storytelling, belief, and much more with me in this continually-wip setting for any system. any content in the [[Homebrew/Homebrew|Homebrew/]] folder is for 5th edition dungeons and dragons, but only because that's what i'm most familiar with. feel free to take any inspiration from this or translate any systems, feats, or anything else into any other systems (just credit me as midnight__sun)

once you're done here, check out the world overview at [[World/World|World/]]
